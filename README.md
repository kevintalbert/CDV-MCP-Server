# Cloudera Data Visualization MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes the full Cloudera Data Visualization (CDV) REST API to AI agents. This lets LLMs list, create, update, and delete CDV resources—groups, users, roles, segments, filter associations, workspaces, datasets, visuals, and data connections—as well as run jobs, query the data API, import/export migrations, and perform operational debugging tasks.

**Supported `visual_type` values for `create_smart_visual`:**

| Type | Use case | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `trellis-bars` | Bar chart — one measure vs. one dimension | Measure on x, dimension on y |
| `trellis-groupedbars` | Grouped bars — one SUM measure, split by color dimension | Use `"shelf": "color_shelf"` for grouping |
| `pie` | Pie chart — SUM measure by dimension | Dimension auto-placed on `color_shelf` |

All other CDV chart types require configuration in **CDV's interactive builder** and are blocked here to prevent broken visuals.

**What is blocked and why:**

| Pattern | Error returned | Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| `count` aggregate | CDV generates `count([col])` that Impala rejects | Use `sum` on a numeric column |
| `trellis-lines`, `scatter`, etc. | Unsupported visual type | Use CDV's builder; use `query_dataapi` for the data |
| Columns starting with `avg_`, `sum_`, etc. as measure targets | CDV tokenizer bug produces `avg([avg_col])` | Choose a different column |
| Date/timestamp columns as dimensions | CDV bracket conversion fails for TIMESTAMP | Use CDV's builder for time-series |
| `filters` parameter | `WHERE ([col])` bracket SQL Impala rejects | Use `query_dataapi` for filtered queries; add filters in CDV's builder |
| Deleting dashboards | Cascade-deletes ALL linked chart visuals | Record visual IDs first; use `delete_visual` carefully |

## Agent Workflow Guidance

### CDV Data Hierarchy

CDV organizes data in three layers, each building on the one below:

```
Connection  (links to an external database, e.g. Impala, Hive, Spark SQL)
  └── Dataset  (points to a specific table or query within that connection)
        └── Visual / Dashboard  (chart or dashboard built on a dataset)
```

Agents must respect this hierarchy when exploring or creating resources.

### Discovery — Always Check Before Creating

Before creating anything, always discover what already exists at each level.

**Step 1 — Connections**

Call `list_connections` to see what data sources are registered in CDV.  
Present the list to the user and identify which connection holds their data.  
Only offer `create_connection` if no suitable connection exists **and** the user explicitly asks for one.

**Step 2 — Datasets**

Call `list_datasets` to see what datasets already exist (these are built on top of connections).  
Present the results and ask the user which dataset to use.  
Only offer `create_dataset` if no suitable dataset exists on the right connection **and** the user explicitly confirms they want a new one. Note that `create_dataset` requires a `dc_id` — the connection ID from Step 1.

**Step 3 — Visuals / Dashboards**

Call `list_visuals` to see what charts/dashboards already exist before building new ones.  
Only call `create_smart_visual` or `create_visual` once the dataset has been confirmed.

> **Never assume anything needs to be created.** CDV instances typically already have connections, datasets, and even visuals the user can reuse.

**Correct flow:**

```
User: "Build me a bar chart of shipment costs"
Agent: list_connections()            ← discover data sources
Agent: "I found these connections: ..."
Agent: list_datasets()               ← discover existing datasets
Agent: "Which dataset should I use?"
User: "Use supplier_shipping_performance"
Agent: list_workspaces()             ← identify target workspace
Agent: create_smart_visual(...)      ← now build the visual
```

**Incorrect flow (avoid):**

```
User: "Build me a bar chart of shipment costs"
Agent: create_connection(...)        ← ❌ never skip discovery
Agent: create_dataset(...)           ← ❌ never create without confirming first
Agent: create_smart_visual(...)
```

### Workspace Discovery — Same Rule Applies

Always call `list_workspaces` before creating a visual or dashboard. Identify the correct workspace ID from the list; only call `create_workspace` if the user explicitly requests a new one.

### Visual Creation Workflow

When `create_smart_visual` is used:

1. Call `list_connections` → understand available data sources.
2. Call `list_datasets` → confirm dataset with user (note which `dc_id` it belongs to).
3. Call `list_workspaces` → identify the target workspace ID.
4. Call `create_smart_visual` with `dataset_id`, `workspace_id`, and column specs.
   - If the Smart Visual API returns 404 (not available on all CDV instances), the tool automatically falls back to the standard admin API using the provided `workspace_id`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CDV_BASE_URL` | Yes | Base URL of your CDV deployment (e.g. `https://my-cdv.example.com`) |
| `CDV_API_KEY` | Yes | CDV API key — sent as `Authorization: apikey <key>` |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | No | Transport protocol: `stdio` (default), `http`, or `sse` |

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add the following to the `mcpServers` section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

### Option 1: Direct installation from GitHub (Recommended)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cdv-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/kevintalbert/cdv-mcp-server@main",
        "run-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CDV_BASE_URL": "https://my-cdv-instance.example.com",
        "CDV_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Local installation (after cloning the repository)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cdv-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/CDV-MCP-Server",
        "run",
        "src/cdv_mcp_server/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CDV_BASE_URL": "https://my-cdv-instance.example.com",
        "CDV_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "CDV_USERNAME": "vizapps_admin",
        "CDV_PASSWORD": "your-cdv-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Option 2, replace `/path/to/CDV-MCP-Server` with your local path.

## Local Development

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the server (stdio transport, default)
uv run run-server

# Run with HTTP transport
MCP_TRANSPORT=http uv run run-server
```

You can also create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:

```env
CDV_BASE_URL=https://my-cdv-instance.example.com
CDV_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
CDV_USERNAME=vizapps_admin
CDV_PASSWORD=your-cdv-password
```

## Transport

The MCP server's transport protocol is configurable via the `MCP_TRANSPORT` environment variable:

- `stdio` **(default)** — communicate over standard input/output. Useful for local tools, CLI scripts, and integrations like Claude Desktop.
- `http` — expose an HTTP server. Useful for web-based deployments and microservices.
- `sse` — use Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport. Useful for existing web-based deployments that rely on SSE.

## Authentication

The server uses two separate authentication mechanisms:

| Credential | Env Var | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| CDV Admin API Key | `CDV_API_KEY` | All admin CRUD, data API, connections, datasets, migrations, jobs. Uses `Authorization: apikey <key>` header. **Required.** |
| CDV Username + Password | `CDV_USERNAME` / `CDV_PASSWORD` | Saving visual shelf configurations (column assignments) via CDV's session-authenticated apps API. **Required for charts to render.** |

**Why two credentials?** CDV's admin API (`arc/adminapi/v1/visuals`) creates visual metadata (title, type, dataset) but does not persist shelf configurations (which columns appear on which axes). Shelf data is stored through CDV's UI API (`arc/reports/report/{id}`), which requires a browser-style session. Without `CDV_USERNAME`/`CDV_PASSWORD`, chart visuals will be created as empty skeletons and CDV's frontend will throw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toUpperCase')` during rendering.

The session is cached in memory and reused across tool calls within a server process.
